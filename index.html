  <p>This timeline is composed of Foundation elements, coupled with CSS and Javascript aspects to culminate the history and timeline of the great and late, Mac Miller. Miller, was more than just a rapper, he was a musician, an artist, a producer, and a genuine kind soul. Many kids that were growing up in 2007-2010 were growing up with Mac Miller. He, first came on the scene through his exceptional youtube videos and obvious lyrical talent. At first some people seen him as 'another white rapper'. However, that didn't seem to bother him that much. His early music consisted of smoking weed, partying, girls, and having fun. With this type of music, there were many people that were growing up doing the same things as him. After he became an established rapper, he became introudced to the drug scene, this was a hard point in time for Miller. He was evolving and adapting his style to a new vibration. Miller was breaking out of the 'frat white boy rap' and showed he was more than that. He started perfecting his craft, locking himself in his studio for days creating and creating and creating. </p>
  <p>Miller, started explaining his life through his music, he wasn't afraid to speak on how he was doing. He explicitly spoke about his drug abuse, not only to release his bottled emotions through this outlet, but also to exclaim to the world 'This is me! I am human!' With this type of personal connection between an artist and his fans, people could relate to his music. Mac Miller was not perfect, however no-one is. He showed the world that it is O.K. to hurt, it is 0.K. to struggle. Moving forward Miller was focused on becoming a better person, recovering, and also perfecting his music. As he released more music, he became a more updated version of himself everytime. His music became less depressing and more uplifting, of course with the cynical and sublime lyrics slipped into pieces. He became wealthy and successful, he gained millions off his music, and saved millions of people going through the same struggle. Sadly, in the end millions couldn't save him. </p>
